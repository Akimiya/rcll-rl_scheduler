abstract="Let $\psi$ be a 2-DNF formula on boolean variables x                1,...,x                                  n                 âˆˆ {\{}0,1{\}}. We present a homomorphic public key encryption scheme that allows the public evaluation of $\psi$ given an encryption of the variables x                1,...,x                                  n                . In other words, given the encryption of the bits x                1,...,x                                  n                , anyone can create the encryption of $\psi$(x                1,...,x                                  n                ). More generally, we can evaluate quadratic multi-variate polynomials on ciphertexts provided the resulting value falls within a small set. We present a number of applications of the system:",
