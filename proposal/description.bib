    abstract="The Full Domain Hash (FDH) scheme is a RSA-based signature scheme in which the message is hashed onto the full domain of the RSA function. The FDH scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model, assuming that inverting RSA is hard. In this paper we exhibit a slightly di.erent proof which provides a tighter security reduction. This in turn improves the e.ciency of the scheme since smaller RSA moduli can be used for the same level of security. The same method can be used to obtain a tighter security reduction for Rabin signature scheme, Paillier signature scheme, and the Gennaro-Halevi-Rabin signature scheme.",

    abstract="We describe an RSA-based signing scheme which combines essentially optimal efficiency with attractive security properties. Signing takes one RSA decryption plus some hashing, verification takes one RSA encryption plus some hashing, and the size of the signature is the size of the modulus. Assuming the underlying hash functions are ideal, our schemes are not only provably secure, but are so in a tight way---an ability to forge signatures with a certain amount of computational resources implies the ability to invert RSA (on the same size modulus) with about the same computational effort. Furthermore, we provide a second scheme which maintains all of the above features and in addition provides message recovery. These ideas extend to provide schemes for Rabin signatures with analogous properties; in particular their security can be tightly related to the hardness of factoring.",

abstract="We initiate the investigation of the class of relations that admit extremely efficient perfect zero knowledge proofs of knowledge: constant number of rounds, communication linear in the length of the statement and the witness, and negligible knowledge error. In its most general incarnation, our result says that for relations that have a particular three-move honest-verifier zero-knowledge (HVZK) proof of knowledge, and which admit a particular three-move HVZK proof of knowledge for an associated commitment relation, perfect zero knowledge (against a general verifier) can be achieved essentially for free, even when proving statements on several instances combined under under monotone function composition. In addition, perfect zero-knowledge is achieved with an optimal 4-moves. Instantiations of our main protocol lead to efficient perfect ZK proofs of knowledge of discrete logarithms and RSA-roots, or more generally, q-one-way group homomorphisms. None of our results rely on intractability assumptions.",
